These are the Recon Hints from NeverLAN CTF 2019

Unexpected Intruder:
occurring in Chicago, Illinois, United States, on the evening of November 22. There was an interruption like nothing we had ever seen before.
What was the name of the Intruder?

Purvesta:
I love Github. Use it all the time! Just wish they could host a webpage...

Let's go way back:
Back in the day, Zesty hid a flag in the first version of our website.

Filling a Need:
This organizations creation was announced Mon Sep 24 2001
What is the full name of the organization?

It's to Keyz:
It looks like N30 has been keeping passwords secret with some software he wrote, but he should know better than to rely on proprietary software for security.
It looks like he left the repo public too!

Teach Them to Hack:
In 2018 NeverlanCTF was one of the Keynotes for a security conference. There is a video of it on youtube. 
I remember seeing a flag. This one is not as easy as you think.
