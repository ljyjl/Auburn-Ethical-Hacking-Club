Return of The Sith
Forensics

Forensics 1:
7z md5 hash: cfb95b3d837602f1932fa309aafd8aff
Password to uncompress: the_path_to_the_dark_side
User's Password: ikilledmydad
Challenge:
After a quick gander, we realized the user installed VNC with a crappy password. Can you get the password he used so we can prove to him it was bad?
Note: The password is the flag, it is not in the flag{} format.

Forensics 2:
Since they got in with VNC, they were locked into his user account, without any root access. The user used SUDO for 'protection' so that means he’s safe from the attacker getting his password, right? The goal here is to figure out if the user was able to escalate to root without having the user's password. DO BE CAREFUL since messing with a VM has the ability to remove traces of what you’re looking for. This IS a forensics challenge.

Forensics 3:
Ok, great. They had full root access, did they leave anything else behind? Any other backdoor?

Notes: This one is also not in the flag format, but the flag will be the 'identifer' of the back door. If you think you've found it, but it's not accepting your challenge, you can message bashNinja on the NeverLAN Slack and he will verify if you've gotten it correct or not.
